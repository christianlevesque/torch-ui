# TorchUI Core

TorchUI is a system for creating Blazor Static SSR components. TorchUI Core contains core utilities for TorchUI packages.

You probably don't want to use TorchUI Core directly unless you're creating your own Blazor Static SSR components. We recommend using one of the existing TorchUI packages instead. Try searching [Nuget](https://nuget.org) for "torchui".
